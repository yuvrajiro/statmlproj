    \item \textbf{Project Overview and Future Plan:} Shape Penalized Decision Forests, for training ensemble classifiers tailored for imbalanced datasets. This package provides two primary implementations:SPBoDF (Shape Penalized Boosting Decision Forest): A boosting ensemble method that builds multiple trees sequentially, adjusting the weights of samples to focus on harder-to-classify instances, and SPBaDF (Shape Penalized Bagging Decision Forest): A bagging ensemble method that builds multiple trees independently on bootstrap samples of the dataset, improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Both implementations use the concept of Surface-to-Volume Regularization (SVR) to penalize irregular decision boundaries, thus improving generalization and addressing challenges associated with imbalanced datasets.

\item {\bf Shape Penalized Decision Forests for Imbalanced Data Classification (Published): } \
Classification trees often yield fragmented minority boundaries under imbalanced data . The authors propose a surface-to-volume ratio (SVR) regularization that penalizes decision-set complexity, optimized via a greedy breadth-first splitting algorithm analogous to CART . Under mild smoothness and margin conditions, On twelve benchmarks, SVR-Trees improve true positive rate, F-measure, and geometric mean over oversampling and alternative trees, and extend naturally to multiclass settings.
